Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE) is a semi-supervised deep model for graph embedding. Which has multiple layers of non-linear functions, thereby being able to capture the highly non-linear network structure. The second-order proximity is used by the unsupervised component to capture the global network structure. While the first-order proximity is used as the supervised information in the supervised component to preserve the local network structure. By jointly optimizing them in the semi-supervised deep model, SDNE can preserve both the local and global network structure and is robust to sparse networks
